**Subject:** Sponsor Clean Air in a Nail Salon — Get Verified Proof That It Actually Happened

---

Hi [Name],

What if your next ESG investment came with proof that couldn't be edited, backdated, or exaggerated?

**The problem you already know about:**

Most ESG reporting relies on estimates, self-reported data, and good-faith projections. It's hard to audit, easy to question, and increasingly under regulatory scrutiny. You know your company is doing the right thing — but proving it to investors, regulators, and the public is a different story.

**What we're doing differently:**

BeautiFi installs smart air quality systems in nail salons — places where workers are exposed to chemical fumes (formaldehyde, toluene, acetone) for 8+ hours a day, every day. Our systems measure the air every 12 seconds, automatically control ventilation, and generate a permanent record of exactly how much toxic air was removed.

When you sponsor a salon through BeautiFi, here's what happens:

1. **You choose a real salon** — a specific business, in a specific city, with real workers
2. **Your contribution is permanently recorded** — it cannot be altered, deleted, or double-counted by anyone, including us
3. **The impact is measured, not estimated** — sensors track pollutant levels and ventilation output continuously throughout the day
4. **You receive a digital certificate** linking your name to the salon you sponsored and the verified impact you funded
5. **You get an audit-ready impact report** documenting exactly how many hours of clean air your sponsorship produced, at which salon, over what time period — with every data point independently verifiable

This isn't a promise of future impact. It's a receipt for impact that already happened.

**Why this is different from offsets:**

Traditional offsets ask you to trust that a tree was planted, or that emissions were reduced somewhere you'll never visit. BeautiFi sponsorships are tied to:

- **A named salon** you can look up, visit, or feature in your reporting
- **Real workers** — predominantly women, many of them immigrants — whose daily health improves because of your support
- **Continuous measurement** — not a one-time audit, but 24/7 sensor data showing exactly what changed
- **A permanent, tamper-proof record** — once recorded, the data can't be retroactively adjusted by anyone

Your impact report doesn't say "we offset X tons of carbon equivalent." It says "we funded the removal of X cubic feet of toxic chemical fumes from [Salon Name] in [City], protecting [N] workers over [Y] hours — and here's the verified data."

**Sponsorship tiers:**

| | Bronze | Silver | Gold | Platinum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Impact** | Sponsor a salon for a month | Sponsor for a quarter | Sponsor for a full year | Lifetime sponsorship |
| **Reporting** | Impact summary | Quarterly vESG reports | Annual vESG reports | Lifetime impact portfolio |
| **Attribution** | Named sponsor on record | Named + salon partnership | Featured sponsor | Founding sponsor recognition |

Every tier includes your digital certificate, your permanent impact record, and verified data you can include directly in your ESG filings.

**Two kinds of sponsors are joining:**

**If you need ESG documentation that holds up** — We generate structured, machine-readable impact reports designed for regulatory and investor scrutiny. Every claim is backed by sensor data, timestamped, and permanently recorded. No hand-waving, no estimates, no "trust us."

**If you simply want to help** — You don't need an ESG department to care about salon workers breathing chemicals all day. Some of our sponsors are beauty brands, salon product companies, or local businesses who just want to make a difference in their community. The certificate and the record are there if you ever need them — but the real reward is knowing a specific salon, with specific people, has cleaner air because of you.

**What we're looking for:**

We're assembling our founding sponsor group — a small cohort of companies and individuals who want to be the first to back verifiable indoor air quality impact. Whether you're solving an ESG reporting gap or simply want to do something good that you can actually prove, we'd love to talk.

Would you have 20 minutes this week? I can show you a live dashboard with real air quality data from one of our pilot salons — you'll see exactly what sponsors receive.

Best,
